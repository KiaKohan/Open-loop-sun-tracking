With increasing air pollution and the limited availability of fossil fuels, the importance of using renewable energies is rapidly on the rise. With the reduction of water resources and the drought in Iran, the need for renewable energy production is vital. 
Solar energy- the most affordable renewable energy - may help solve future problems. However, solar cells (responsible for converting solar energy to electrical energy) have low efficiency, highlighting the need to increase efficiency in solar systems. 
In this project, a heat exchanger system with a two-axis tracker was designed and built for the solar panel, which tracks the sun during the day and  places the panel perpendicular to the sun's rays. and this system has been compared with a reference system where the solar panel is fixed, and with a solar panel with a tracker and without a heat exchanger. In general, solar tracking systems are controlled in two ways; open-loop and closed-loop. In this project, both open-loop and closed-loop method was used. After all optimizations, the system  recorded a 35% increase in electrical energy production and a 750% increase energy production in one day (total thermal and electrical energy) compared to the reference system, which was a fixed panel.
